# Generative AI Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Generative AI repository! This project documents my complete learning path, starting from the fundamental building blocks of Natural Language Processing (NLP) all the way to building advanced Autonomous Agents.

## 🎯 Goal
My goal is to master the full stack of Generative AI technologies. I am documenting everything I learn here to share knowledge and track my progress.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) 📝
Understanding how machines process human language.
*   **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal.
*   **Feature Extraction**: Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF.

*(More modules coming soon: LLMs, RAG, Agents)*

## 📂 Repository Structure
*   **`NLP/`**: Contains all code and notes related to traditional NLP techniques.
